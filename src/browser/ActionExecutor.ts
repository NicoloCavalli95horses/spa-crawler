   * — e.g. a "welcome back" dialog that shows up non-deterministically on load, unrelated to anything
   * the exploration itself did — now sits on top of it: `locateTarget`'s hit-test sees the dialog,
   * not the real target, and reports it as unreachable, exactly as if it had actually disappeared.
   * Confirmed live on busuu: a stray "welcome back" modal was seen mid-run; this is almost certainly
   * why individual (state, element) pairs went permanently unexplored (DfsExplorer.visit marks an
   * element explored BEFORE attempting it, so a single bad-luck miss here is never retried later) even
   * though the exact same click/stability pipeline, run once in isolation, reaches the target cleanly.
   * One retry is enough: OverlayDismisser.dismiss() already tries twice internally (Escape, then an
   * explicit close control) before giving up, and the busuu case genuinely is a one-off dialog.
   *
   * If that still isn't enough — the blocker has no ARIA modal semantics at all, so Escape and the
   * close-control search both find nothing to act on — hideBlockingOverlay is tried as a last resort:
   * it reuses this very call's own failed hit-test to hide (display:none, never removed) exactly
   * whatever is actually sitting on top of the target, no DOM-diffing/guessing involved. See that
   * function's own doc comment for why it can never end up hiding the real target by mistake.
