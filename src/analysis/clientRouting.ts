/**
 * Shared browser-side helper, inlined into both probes below. Watches the DOM after a synthetic
 * route change and resolves with whether anything mutated, with three windows:
 *
 * - `minWait` (floor): the earliest a reaction may be reported settled. A route that renders in
 *   bursts, or a router that redirects an unrecognized path to its fallback, needs a little time to
 *   fully manifest before `finalUrl`/the mutation flag are read; the floor guarantees that.
 * - `idleTime` (settle): once a mutation has happened, resolve after the DOM has been quiet this long.
 * - `maxWait` (ceiling): an absolute stop. It does two things the old floor-only loop could not:
 *     (1) it guarantees termination even on a page that never goes quiet (a persistent spinner or
 *         polling that mutates faster than `idleTime` — the old loop would have waited forever), and
 *     (2) it keeps watching for a FIRST mutation past the floor. A route whose render is gated on a
 *         slow network fetch can start mutating only after `minWait`; the old code gave up exactly at
 *         the floor and reported "no reaction", a false negative. Here, nothing is reported settled
 *         until something has actually mutated, so such a late first render is still caught (up to the
 *         ceiling); a route that genuinely never reacts simply rides to `maxWait` and reports false.
 *
 * The MutationObserver is attached synchronously, before the caller dispatches the popstate event
 * that may trigger a router's (usually synchronous, for non-React routers) DOM update — attaching it
 * after dispatchEvent would miss exactly that common case.
 *
 * A hand-written JS source string, not a TS function literal passed to page.evaluate(): tsx/esbuild's
 * name-preservation transform injects `__name(...)` helper calls into compiled functions, and once
 * Playwright serializes such a function for the page, that helper (which only exists in this Node
 * process's module scope) is undefined there. A string literal is opaque to the compiler, so nothing
 * gets instrumented inside it.

/**
 * Port of RAPIDOR's requestGenerator.js isUsingQueryParams/waitDOMIdle fallback: when a forged real
 * HTTP request for a query-param candidate does not look like it succeeded (or never could, because
 * the candidate value is never sent over the network at all — a purely client-routed SPA), check
 * whether the page's own client-side routing honors that query param anyway, independently of any
 * server response. Mutates the live page's location (pushState + a synthetic popstate, since raw
 * pushState alone does not fire anything) and watches whether the DOM reacts; always rolls the URL
 * back, even on an unexpected error. Requires `installParamUsageTracking` to have already run on
 * `page` (an init script, so it is in place before any app code loads).
 *
 * `minWaitMs`/`idleMs`/`maxWaitMs` size the waitDomIdle window (floor / settle / ceiling — see
 * WAIT_DOM_IDLE_SRC's own doc comment): AnalysisPipeline passes config.analysis.clientRoutingProbe
 * explicitly, sized to match the rest of the pipeline's own settle windows rather than the much
 * shorter 500/100ms this used to hardcode — see that config field's own comment. Optional here
 * (defaulting to that same config value) only so standalone scripts and previously generated
 * reproduction scripts that call this directly, without threading the config through, keep compiling
 * and behave the same as a real pipeline run.
 *
 * `isUsingNewParams` also requires the browser to still be sitting on `testUrl`'s own pathname once
 * the DOM settles: a false positive observed on busuu (dashboard/review -> dashboard/dashboard,
 * client-routing-path) showed the app's router silently redirecting an unrecognized route to its own
 * fallback (dashboard/timeline) — a real DOM mutation (the fallback page rendering), but evidence the
 * candidate was REJECTED, not accepted. Without this guard that redirect reads identically to a
 * genuine "the app rendered the candidate's content".

 * (a router redirecting an unrecognized path to its fallback) this guards against. It matters even
 * more here than in the query-param probe above: there is no __accessedParams signal for a path
