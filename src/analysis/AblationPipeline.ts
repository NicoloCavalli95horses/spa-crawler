/**
 * Ablation study: the same IDOR-detection oracle as AnalysisPipeline (forge the candidate request,
 * compare the real response, diff the two objects' properties, classify the diff for authz
 * relevance), but candidate generation NEVER touches React state at all — only the JSON bodies of
 * already-captured HTTP responses. The question this answers: how much of what AnalysisPipeline
 * finds actually required the React-state-derived signal (component siblings, client-side-only
 * query params, client-routed path segments — none of which exist here), versus how much was
 * sitting in plain sight in the JSON the site's own API already returned?
 *
 * Candidate generation, replacing matchFinder's componentIndex walk: for a URL segment that matches
 * a value inside that SAME request's own JSON response body (findJsonMatches, the JSON analog of
 * PreindexedValueStore.findByValue), the "siblings" are other elements of the nearest enclosing
 * array in that body (findJsonCandidates) — the JSON idiom for "multiple instances of the same kind
 * of entity", playing the role RAPIDOR's componentIndex plays for React nodes.
 *
 * Deliberately narrower than AnalysisPipeline by construction, not by omission: there is no
 * equivalent of the client-routing probes (checkClientSideRouting/checkClientSideRoutingForPath).
 * Those resolve their oracle from a DOM-mutation signal (did the app's own rendering react?), which
 * is inherently a browser-level observation with no network counterpart at all — feeding this
 * pipeline the URLs reached only via client-side routing would not help, since there would still be
 * no way to tell whether the app actually uses such a value without watching the DOM react to it.
 * Expect this pipeline to flag strictly fewer candidates than AnalysisPipeline on the same site; a
 * comparison script (see scripts/compareAblation.ts) reports by how much, over analysis_stats vs
 * ablation_stats, bucketed by the main pipeline's own detectionMethod so this exact gap is visible.
 *
 * Matching searches the WHOLE site's own corpus, not just "this URL's own response": the id a
 * request's own URL carries is often only ever RETURNED, alongside its siblings, by a completely
 * different endpoint (a list/listing call), not by the per-item endpoint whose own URL happens to
 * contain it (see buildJsonPreindex's own doc comment). Sibling-finding itself still never crosses
 * bodies — only the lookup does — since two different HTTP responses cannot be assumed to describe
 * related data just because a value happens to appear in both.
