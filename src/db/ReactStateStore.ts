   * two captures that share it can still carry different data (a page whose siblings/props finished
   * loading later, a cache warming up, ...). PreindexedValueStore.reindex() is always called by the
   * caller with this same fresh `graph`, replacing that state's indexed rows every time regardless
   * of whether this was a fresh insert or a repeat — so if the stored graph here stayed frozen at
   * the first capture, a later reindex would point AnalysisPipeline.findUrlCandidates' getById(id)
   * read at a stale, mismatched node graph (even referencing nodeIds that don't exist in it, since
   * every remount gets fresh RAPIDOR-assigned ids), silently losing whatever that later, possibly
   * more complete, capture actually saw. Always keeping the latest graph guarantees the opposite:
   * redundant captures are harmless, never a source of lost coverage.
